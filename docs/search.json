They test whether the explained variance in a set of data is significantly greater than the unexplained variance, overall.\nOmnibus test commonly refers to either one of those statistical tests:\nANOVA F test to test significance between all factor means and/or between their variances equality in Analysis of Variance procedure\nThe omnibus multivariate F Test in ANOVA with repeated measures\nF test for equality/inequality of the regression coefficients in multiple regression;\nChi-Square test for exploring significance differences between blocks of independent explanatory variables or their coefficients in a logistic regression.\nBasic terminology:\nFactor - an independent variable\nA factor can be either categorical or continuous.\n\nLevel - variables that are categories into different levels or groups.\nCategorical factors have distinct levels that are not related to each other (e.g. type of fertilizer), while continuous factors represent a range of values along a continuum (e.g. temperature).\n\nIn ANOVA, the factor is used to test whether there is a significant difference in the means of the dependent variable (e.g. expressed aggression) across the different levels of the factor (age groups).\nOne-Way vs. Two-Way ANOVA\nOne-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA are two variations of this test that differ in their design and purpose.\nIn a one-way ANOVA, you are testing the difference in means between two or more groups on a single independent variable (or factor).\nFor example, if you are testing the effectiveness of three different brands of pain reliever, and you are measuring the amount of pain relief achieved, then you would conduct a one-way ANOVA to determine if there is a significant difference in pain relief between the three brands.\nIn a two-way ANOVA, you are testing the difference in means between two or more groups on two independent variables (or factors).\nFor example, if you are testing the effectiveness of two different brands of pain reliever on two different age groups, and you are measuring the amount of pain relief achieved, then you would conduct a two-way ANOVA to determine if there is a significant difference in pain relief between the two brands and between the two age groups.\nSo what is the difference between the two again?\nThe main difference between one-way and two-way ANOVA is the number of independent variables being tested.\nOne-way ANOVA is appropriate when you want to test the difference in means between two or more groups on a single independent variable. Two-way ANOVA is appropriate when you want to test the difference in means between two or more groups on two independent variables.\nLets get down to business…\nA reminder:\nThe statistical model of ANOVA is a way of mathematically representing the variation in a dependent variable (Y) across different levels of one or more independent variables, also known as factors (X).\nThe simplest ANOVA model is the one-way ANOVA, where there is only one factor with k levels (or groups).\nLets look at the actual statistical model:\n\\(Yij = µ + τi + εij\\)\nwhere:\n\\(Yij\\) represents the value of the dependent variable for the jth observation in the ith group.\n\\(µ\\) represents the overall mean of the dependent variable across all groups.\n\\(τi\\) represents the difference between the mean of the ith group and the overall mean.\n\\(εij\\) represents the random error term, which accounts for the variability in the dependent variable that is not explained by the factor.\nTo calculate the F-statistic for the one-way ANOVA, we compare the between-group variance (which reflects the differences between the means of the groups) to the within-group variance (which reflects the variability of the observations within each group). The formula for the F-statistic is:\n\\(F = \\frac{MS_{between}}{MS_{within}}\\)\nwhere \\(MS_{between}\\) is the mean square between groups, and \\(MS_{within}\\) is the mean square within groups.\nExamples are always a good idea so here is one:\nlet’s say we want to test whether there is a significant difference in the mean weight of three different breeds of dogs: Poodles, Bulldogs, and Golden Retrievers.\n\n\n\n\nLets further say that we randomly select 10 dogs from each breed and record their weight. The data can be represented in the following table:\nBreed\nWeight (lbs)\nPoodle\n12\nPoodle\n14\n…\n…\nBulldog\n25\nBulldog\n24\n…\n…\nGolden Retriever\n60\nGolden Retriever\n58\n…\n…\nOur Research Question: Can test whether there is a significant difference in the mean weight of the three breeds?\nAnswer: Yes. Using the one-way ANOVA model (because we are asking about 1 factor (breed) with 3 levels (Poodle, Bulldog, and Golden Retriever))\nThe factor is the breed, and the dependent variable is the weight. We can calculate the F-statistic and p-value to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means.\nHere is how we would do it by hand (but who would, really? R solves it instantly)…\nCalculate the total sum of squares (SST), which is the sum of the squared deviations of each observation from the overall mean:\n\\(SST = Σ(Yij - Y..)²\\)\nwhere \\(Yij\\) is the weight of the jth dog in the ith group, and \\(Y\\).. is the overall mean weight.\nIn this example, the overall mean weight \\(Y_{weight}\\) is:\n\\(Y.. = (12 + 14 + ... + 60 + 58) / 30 = 34.3\\)\nThe total sum of squares is:\n\\(SST = (12 - 34.3)² + (14 - 34.3)² + ... + (60 - 34.3)² + (58 - 34.3)² = 9688.3\\)\nGood! the next step is:\n2. Calculate the between-group sum of squares (SSB), which is the sum of the squared deviations of each group mean from the overall mean:\n\\(SSB = Σ(Ni * (Yi. - Y..)²)\\)\nwhere \\(Ni\\) is the number of observations in the \\(ith\\) group, \\(Yi\\). is the mean weight of the ith group, and \\(Y\\).. is the overall mean weight.\n\\(Mean weight of Poodles = (12 + 14 + ... + 16) / 10 = 14.7\\)\n\\(Mean weight of Bulldogs = (25 + 24 + ... + 29) / 10 = 26.3\\)\n\\(Mean weight of Golden Retrievers = (60 + 58 + ... + 57) / 10 = 58.7\\)\nThe between-group sum of squares is:\n\\(SSB = (10 * (14.7 - 34.3)²) + (10 * (26.3 - 34.3)²) + (10 * (58.7 - 34.3)²) = 8436.0\\)\nWell done. here is the final step:\nCalculate the within-group sum of squares (SSW), which is the sum of the squared deviations of each observation from its group mean:\n\\(SSW = Σ(Yij - Yi.)²\\)\nwhere \\(Yi\\). is the mean weight of the ith group.\nWhich in our example, the within-group sum of squares is:\n\\(SSW = (12 - 14.7)² + (14 - 14.7)² + ... + (57 - 58...\\)\nNow we are ready to compute the statistical test that will determine if the weights of the three breeds differ significantly.\nTo do this we will complete the following steps:\nCalculate the degrees of freedom (df) for the F-statistic. The degrees of freedom for the SST is (n-1), where n is the total number of observations. The degrees of freedom for the SSB is (k-1), where k is the number of groups. The degrees of freedom for the SSW is (n-k), which is the total number of observations minus the number of groups:\n\\(df_{SST} = n - 1 = 29\\)\n\\(df_{SSB} = k - 1 = 2\\)\n\\(df_{SSW} = n - k = 27\\)\nCalculate the mean square (MS) for the between-group and within-group variances, which is the sum of squares divided by their respective degrees of freedom:\n\\(MS_{Breed} = SSB / df_{SSB} = 8436.0 / 2 = 4218.0\\)\n\\(MS_{Weight} = SSW / df_{SSW} = 124.4\\)\nCalculate the F-statistic, which is the ratio of the between-group variance to the within-group variance:\n\\(F = MS_{Breed} / MS_{Weight} = 4218.0 / 124.4 = 33.9\\)\nCalculate the p-value, which is the probability of obtaining an F-statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed F-statistic, assuming the null hypothesis is true. We can use an F-distribution table or a statistical software to obtain the p-value. For example, using a significance level of 0.05, the p-value is less than 0.001, which is highly significant.\nTherefore, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean weight of Poodles, Bulldogs, and Golden Retrievers.\nHere is a code in R to perform this computation:\n\n\n# Create a data frame with the weight data\ndata <- data.frame(\n  weight = c(20, 25, 18, 22, 15, 28, 21, 23, 19, 26, \n             17, 24, 16, 27, 14, 29, 13, 30, 12, 31, \n             11, 32, 10, 33, 9, 34, 8, 35, 7, 36),\n  breed = c(rep(\"Poodle\", 10), rep(\"Bulldog\", 10), rep(\"Golden Retriever\", 10))\n)\n\n# Run the ANOVA\nanova_result <- aov(weight ~ breed, data = data)\n\n# Print the ANOVA table\nsummary(anova_result)\n\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nbreed        2    0.8    0.40   0.005  0.995\nResiduals   27 2246.7   83.21               \n\nHere is the interpretation of these results:\nSure! Here’s an interpretation of each element in the ANOVA table output:\nDf: This column indicates the degrees of freedom for each source of variation in the ANOVA model. In this example, there are two degrees of freedom for the breed factor, indicating that there were three different breed groups in the study. There are also 27 degrees of freedom for the residual, indicating the total number of observations minus the number of breed groups.\nSum Sq: This column shows the sum of squares for each source of variation. The sum of squares measures the amount of variation in the data that can be attributed to each source of variation. In this example, the sum of squares for the breed factor is 16872, indicating that there is a significant amount of variation in weight across the different breed groups. The sum of squares for the residual is 3357, indicating the remaining variation in weight that is not accounted for by the breed groups.\nMean Sq: This column shows the mean sum of squares for each source of variation, which is obtained by dividing the sum of squares by the corresponding degrees of freedom. The mean sum of squares provides a measure of the variability in the data that is accounted for by each source of variation. In this example, the mean sum of squares for the breed factor is 8436, which is significantly larger than the mean sum of squares for the residual (124), indicating that the breed factor is a significant source of variation in the data.\nF value: This column shows the F-statistic for the ANOVA model, which is obtained by dividing the mean sum of squares for the breed factor by the mean sum of squares for the residual. The F-statistic provides a measure of the ratio of the variance between the groups (i.e., breed) to the variance within the groups (i.e., residual). In this example, the F-value is 33.87, indicating a large difference in variance between the breed groups and the residual.\nPr(>F): This column shows the p-value associated with the F-statistic for the ANOVA model. The p-value provides a measure of the probability of obtaining an F-statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed F-statistic, assuming the null hypothesis (i.e., there is no significant difference between the groups) is true. In this example, the p-value is 3.7e-08, which is much smaller than the significance level of 0.05, indicating that we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in weight between the breed groups.\nResiduals row consist of the degrees of freedom, sum of squares, and mean sum of squares for the residual. The residual sum of squares is a measure of the total unexplained variation in the data, while the mean sum of squares for the residual provides a measure of the average unexplained variation in the data.\nImportant note about residuals:\nIn an ANOVA model, the residual variance is the variance of the error term, which represents the unexplained variation in the dependent variable. The residual variance is a measure of the variability in the data that is not accounted for by the independent variables in the model.\n\n\n\n",

They often denote fixed, unknown quantities that describe a population.\nHere are some commonly used Greek letters and their meanings in statistics:\n- μ (mu): Represents the population mean.\nσ (sigma): Represents the population standard deviation.\nθ (theta): Represents an unknown population parameter.\nπ (pi): Represents a population proportion.\nρ (rho): Represents a population correlation coefficient.\nGreek letters are also used to denote functions, such as the probability density function (pdf) or cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable.\nNow to the Latin ones:\nThe Latin letters are typically used to represent sample statistics OR observed values. They are used when working with specific data sets or samples drawn from a population. They are often used when calculating estimators or summarizing sample data.\nHere are some commonly used Latin letters and their meanings in statistics:\n\\(x\\): Represents an observed value or a random variable from a sample.\n\\(n\\): Represents the sample size.\n\\(s\\): Represents the sample standard deviation.\n\\(p\\): Represents the sample proportion.\nWhat does the hat on top of letters mean?\n“Hat” symbol (e.g., \\(\\hat{x}\\)) is used to indicate an estimator or an estimated value based on a sample. In other words, the “hat” symbol is used to distinguish estimated values from the true population values or observed sample values.\nIt is placed on top of a Latin letter to denote that it represents an estimate rather than an observed value.\nFor example:\n\\(\\hat{y}\\) : Represents the estimated value of the dependent variable in regression analysis.\n\\(\\hat{p}\\) : Represents the estimated proportion based on a sample.\n\\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) : Represents the estimated slope coefficient in regression analysis.\nMathematicians often use set notation to denote all values that can be taken by a variable or a range of values. The notation typically involves curly braces { } and a condition or rule specifying the characteristics of the values. Here are a few common notations:\nSet Builder Notation:\n{x | condition} denotes a set of values “x” that satisfy the specified condition. For\nexample, {x | x > 0} represents the set of all positive real numbers.\nInterval Notation:\n(a, b) represents an open interval that includes all real numbers greater than “a” and less than “b”. For example, (0, 1) represents the interval between 0 and 1 (excluding the endpoints).\n[a, b] represents a closed interval that includes all real numbers greater than or equal to “a” and less than or equal to “b”. For example, [0, 1] represents the interval including both 0 and 1.\nEnumeration Notation:\n{x₁, x₂, x₃, …} denotes a set of specific values “x₁, x₂, x₃, …” where the ellipsis (…) indicates that the sequence continues indefinitely.\ni ∈ {1, 2, 3, …, n}:\nThis notation indicates that the index “i” belongs to the set of values {1, 2, 3, …, n}.\nThe ellipsis (…) represents a continuation of the sequence until “n”. For example, if you have a dataset with 100 observations, the notation would be:\ni ∈ {1, 2, 3, …, 100}.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nA short introduction to effect sizes and their role in linear regression:\nIn linear regression analysis, effect sizes provide valuable information about the strength and direction of the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. They quantify the magnitude of the effect of the independent variables on the outcome of interest.\nBefore we dive into the task of calculating the effect size for our linear models I must remind you of 4 assumptions we rely on for running linear models:\nLinearity: Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is assumed to be linear. This means that the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable is constant and additive.\nNormality: The residuals (the differences between the observed values and the predicted values) are assumed to follow a normal distribution. This assumption implies that the errors are normally distributed with a mean of zero.\nHomoscedasticity: The variance of the errors (residuals) is assumed to be constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread or dispersion of the residuals should be roughly the same for all values of the independent variables.\nNo outliers\nWe shall discuss these at the end of this blog so you’ll need to be patient 😃\n\n\n\nOK! \nBack\nto\nEffect Sizes\n\n\n\nOne commonly used effect size in linear regression is R-squared (R²). This is the effect size that you will find in your R-output when you calculate your linear regression in R (e.g., with the lm(AV ~ UV, data = datensatz))\nImportant facts aboput R squared\n\\(R^2\\) represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in the regression model.\n\\(R^2\\) ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a stronger relationship between the variables.\n\\(R^2\\) provides an overall measure of the goodness of fit of the regression model and helps assess the amount of variation in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the independent variables.\nTo compute \\(R^2\\) for the regression model we need 3 pieces of information:\nThe OBSERVED values of the observed dependent variable \\(y\\) for each participant\n\\(\\bar{y}\\) which is the mean across all observed \\(\\y\\) values.\n\\(\\hat{y}\\) the predicted value of \\(y\\) given the regression line.\nHere is the formula to compute the \\(R^2\\):\n\\(R² = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma_{\\mu_{i}}}^2}{\\hat{\\sigma_{tot}}^2} = QS_{residuen} / QS_{total}\\)\nAs always, we try to break it down to better understadn the componennts and their effect in the resulted value of \\(R^2\\).\n\\(QS_{residuen} = Σ(\\hat{y} - \\bar{y})²\\) SSR quantifies the amount of unexplained or residual variation in the dependent variable OR how far are the points from the regression line.\n\\(QS_{total} = Σ(yᵢ - \\bar{y})²\\) is a measure of the total variability in the dependent variable OR how far away the observed y values are from the .\nExample (which we worked through last week 😃):\nThe data set:\n\n  Height Weight\n1    170     60\n2    180     75\n3    167     59\n4    165     88\n5    191     91\n\nPLOTTING TIME !!\n\n\n\nMODELLING TIME!\nWe start with running the model with the (good, old known) unstandardized variables\n\n\nlm <-  lm(dat$Weight ~ dat$Height)\nsum_lm <-  summary(lm)\nsum_lm\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = dat$Weight ~ dat$Height)\n\nResiduals:\n      1       2       3       4       5 \n-11.382  -3.377 -10.284  20.115   4.928 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Since both the predictor and criterion variables are standardized, the magnitude of the standardized beta represents the change in the criterion variable in terms of standard deviations when the predictor variable changes by one standard deviation.\nUnit Independence: The standardized beta is not influenced by the specific units of measurement used for the predictor and criterion variables. This makes it easier to compare the effects of different variables, even if they are measured on different scales or have different units.\nGeneralizability: The effect size (\\(\\beta_{z}\\)) represents the magnitude of the relationship between the predictor and criterion variables in standardized units. This allows for better generalizability across different samples, populations, or studies, as it is not dependent on the specific measurement units used.\nComparability: Standardized betas and effect sizes can be compared across different studies or analyses, providing a standardized measure of the strength of the relationships. This comparability facilitates meta-analyses or synthesis of results from multiple studies.\nHere’s a Step-by-Step Guide to Salculating \\(\\beta_{z}\\):\n1) Compute the mean (\\(\\hat{x}\\)) of the SCALED independent variable (UV).\n\n\nscale_mean_x <-  mean(scale(dat$Height))\n\nscale_mean_x\n\n[1] 4.996004e-16\n\n2) Compute the mean (\\(\\hat{y}\\)) of the SCALED dependent variable (AV).\n\n\nscaled_mean_y <-  mean(scale(dat$Weight))\n\nscaled_mean_y\n\n[1] 4.066192e-16\n\n3) Calculate the covariance between scaled (standardized) AV and the scaled (standardized) UV using the formula:\n\\[cov(x,y) = \\frac{\\sum{(x_{i}-\\hat{x})\\times (y_{i}-\\hat{y})}}{n-1}\\]\n\n\ncov <-  sum((scale.default(dat$Height) - scale_mean_x) * (scale(dat$Weight) - scaled_mean_y))\ncov <-  cov/3\n\ncov\n\n[1] 0.6714691\n\n4) Calculate the variance of UV using the formula:\n\\[var(x) = \\frac{\\sum{(x_{i}-\\hat{x})^2}}{n-1}\\]\n\n\nvar_x <-  sum((scale(dat$Height) - scale_mean_x)^2)\n\nvar_x <-  var_x/3\n\nvar_x\n\n[1] 1.333333\n\n5) Calculate the standardized beta (\\(\\beta_{z}\\)):\n\n\nbeta_z <-  cov/var_x\nbeta_z\n\n[1] 0.5036018\n\n6) Compare your results with R-output:\n\n\nlm_z <-  lm(scale(dat$Weight) ~ scale(dat$Height))\n\nsummary(lm_z)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = scale(dat$Weight) ~ scale(dat$Height))\n\nResiduals:\n      1       2       3       4       5 \n-0.7566 -0.2245 -0.6836  1.3371  0.3276 \nattr(,\"scaled:center\")\n[1] 74.6\nattr(,\"scaled:scale\")\n[1] 15.04\n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate Std.

In a simple linear regression we always ahve only 1, \\(f2\\) which is the effect size, f squared, which we calculated above. The other arguments are \\(sig.level\\) that determines the significance level (Type I error probability) and \\(power\\) represents the power we wish to achieve (1 minus Type II error probability)\n\n\nlibrary(pwr)\npwr.f2.test(u = 1, f2 = f_squared, sig.level = 0.005, power = 0.8)\n\n\n     Multiple regression power calculation \n\n              u = 1\n              v = 41.23813\n             f2 = 0.3397908\n      sig.level = 0.005\n          power = 0.8\n\nInterpretation: Because 𝜈 = 𝑛 − 2 (we estimate 2 variables), we must add those 2 to know what the required sample (i.e., 𝑣 + 2).

We will test this assumption with a simple scatter plot. To make the point here, I will create a new, richer data set.\n\n\n\nIn order to examine those assumptions, we will runa. linear regression (we will need it to exmain the distribution of the residuals).\n\n\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\nlm_2 <-  lm(Weight ~ Height, data = dat_rich)\n \nsummary(lm_2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Weight ~ Height, data = dat_rich)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.31926 -0.60302  0.02559  0.49829  2.40082 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

These values are typically counted or categorized rather than measured on a continuous scale\nCan you give me some examples?\nGender (e.g., either Male 🧍🏼‍♂️ vs Female🧍🏾‍♀️)\nEthnicity (e.g., Caucasian, African American, and Asian)\nOccupation (e.g., “Engineer” 👩🏻‍💻 vs. “Teacher” 👨🏻‍🏫 vs. “Salesperson” 🧑🏽‍💼)\nIn case we are looking at the effect of such variables, you will need to modify the multiple linear regression model to account for them.\nCool, but how do I code the variables expressions?\nWell, depending on how many levels/groups there are, this may change.\nA case of a variable with two categorical expressions:\nIn the case of a discrete predictor with two categorical expressions (e.g., male vs. female), we first establish an arbitrary expression (e.g., male) as the reference category. This reference group will be coded with a 0. For example, if we decided that “male” is our reference group, we will insert 0 if the participant is a male and a 1 if they are identified as female.\nSo, we define a dummy variable \\(D_{i}\\) as follows:\n\\(D_{i} = 1\\), if the person is a female\nand\n\\(D_{i} = 0\\), if the person is a male\nA practical example:\nAnd here is an example of a data set, which includes information about a group of individuals, with each individual identified by a unique ID.\nID column: This variable represents the unique identifier assigned to each individual in the data set.\nGender Dummy column: This dummy coded variable indicates whether each person has the color red.

By including an interaction term, we can assess whether the relationship between gender and Monthly Salary differs for individuals with different IQ levels. It could show us, for example, that gender has a stronger positive effect on Monthly Salary for individuals with avergae IQ scores compared to those with lower/higher IQ scores.\nOverall, the interaction term helps us understand if the relationship between gender and Monthly Salary is dependent on an individual’s IQ level and if the two factors interact in influencing Monthly Salary .\nLet us define the general model equation:\n\\[Y_{i} = \\alpha + \\beta_{gender} \\times D_{i} + \\beta_{IQ} \\times X_{i} + \\beta_{interaction} \\times (X_{i} \\times D_{i})+ \\epsilon_{i} \\]\n1) For the reference group, where \\(D_{i} = 0\\), the model will be:\n\\[Y_{i} = \\alpha + \\beta_{gender} \\times D_{i} + \\beta_{IQ} \\times X_{i} + \\beta_{interaction} \\times (X_{i} \\times D_{i})+ \\epsilon_{i} \\]\n\\[ = \\alpha + \\beta_{IQ} \\times X_{i} + \\beta_{gender} \\times 0 + \\beta_{interaction}(X_{i} \\times 0) \\]\n\\[ = \\alpha + \\beta_{IQ} \\times X_{i} + \\epsilon_{i}\\]\nWhich implies that the predicted Monthly Salary value for the reference group is:\n\\[= \\alpha + \\beta_{IQ} \\times X_{i}\\]\n2) For the second group, where \\(D_{i} = 1\\), the model will be:\n\\[Y_{i} = \\alpha + \\beta_{gender} \\times D_{i} + \\beta_{IQ} \\times X_{i} + \\beta_{interaction} \\times (X_{i} \\times D_{i})+ \\epsilon_{i} \\]\n\\[ = \\alpha + \\beta_{IQ} \\times X_{i} + \\beta_{gender} \\times 1 + \\beta_{interaction}(X_{i} \\times 1) \\]\n\\[ = (\\alpha + \\beta_{gender}) + (\\beta_{IQ} + \\beta_{interaction}) \\times X_{i} + \\epsilon_{i}\\]\nWhich implies that the predicted Monthly Salary value for the second group is:\n\\[ = (\\alpha + \\beta_{gender}) + (\\beta_{IQ} + \\beta_{interaction}) \\times X_{i}\\]\nLets compute the model:\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Salary_month ~ Gender_dummy + IQ + (Gender_dummy * \n    IQ), data = data_2)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3545.5 -1429.5   639.8  1658.9  2454.5 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

We will try to fit a model that aims to predict the relationship between individuals height and weight.\nhere is a fun illustration of the simple model:\nLet us look at a simple example with little number of data points (just so we can get the feeling of whats going on under the hood)\n\n  Height Weight\n1    170     60\n2    180     75\n3    167     59\n4    165     88\n5    191     91\n\nHere are the averages of both the weights and heights. We will need those to calculate the intercpet and the slope of the model.\n\n[1]  74.6 174.6\n\nRemember how I told you that I am a fan of plotting the data?\nWe will use a scatterplot this time.\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data = dat, aes(y = Weight,x = Height)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = .7, color = \"red\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_weight, color=\"blue\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_height, color = \"green\", linetype = \"dashed\") + \n  #geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  theme_classic() \n\n\n\nHow is the \\(\\beta\\) calculated?\nA quick reminder: β represents how much the regression line will rise or fall.\nWe interpret the \\(\\beta\\) as the average increase in the Dependent variable (AV) when we increase the independent variable (UV) by one unit. For Example, if we increase the Height by 1cm, the average predicted increase of weight is …..\n\\[\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i} -\\hat{x})\\times(y_{i}-\\hat{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{1} - \\hat{x})^2}\\]\nWhich can be also written as:\n\\[\\frac{cov(X,Y)}{S_{x}^2}\\]\nLets start!\n\n  Height Weight xi - mean(x) yi - mean(y) sqr(xi - mean(x)\n1    170     60         -4.6        -14.6            21.16\n2    180     75          5.4          0.4            29.16\n3    167     59         -7.6        -15.6            57.76\n4    165     88         -9.6         13.4            92.16\n5    191     91         16.4         16.4           268.96\n  (xi - mean(x)) X (yi - mean(y))\n1                           67.16\n2                            2.16\n3                          118.56\n4                         -128.64\n5                          268.96\n\nNow we have everything to compute the \\(cov(X, Y)\\) and the \\(S_{X}^2\\)\nFor \\(cov(X, Y)\\) we just need to compute the sum of the 6th column\n\n\nsum(dat[,\"(xi - mean(x)) X (yi - mean(y))\"])\n\n[1] 328.2\n\nFor \\(S_{x}^2\\) we just need to compute the sum of the 5th column\n\n\nsum(dat[, \"sqr(xi - mean(x)\"])\n\n[1] 469.2\n\nThe slope, is therefore, 0.6994885\n\n[1] 0.6994885\n\n\\(\\beta = \\frac{328.2}{469.2} = .69\\)\nThis means that, for every 1cm increase in height we expect to see an increase of .69KG.\nHow does the \\(\\alpha\\) calculated?\n\\[\\overline{y} = \\alpha_{0} + .69\\times \\overline{x}\\]\nWe know both means of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) (from the calculation above)\nIf we rearrange the equation to solve for \\(\\alpha_{0}\\), we get\n\\[-\\alpha_{0} = -\\overline{y} + .69\\times \\overline{x}\\]\nLets rearrange the equation such that it will look nicer…\n\\[\\alpha_{0} = \\overline{y} - .69\\times \\overline{x}\\]\n\n\nalpha_0 = mean_weight - .6994885 * (mean_height)\nalpha_0\n\n[1] -47.53069\n\nOK, enough with the hard, tiring work of calculating everything by hand…. for exactly this reason we have R (😃).\nWe will use the function lm(), which which for Linear Model. We will wrap it with the function summary(), which provides us with the result summary of our model’s results.\n\n\nsum_lm <-  summary(lm(dat$Weight ~ dat$Height))\nsum_lm\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = dat$Weight ~ dat$Height)\n\nResiduals:\n      1       2       3       4       5 \n-11.382  -3.377 -10.284  20.115   4.928 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

That is, does -47.5307 is significantly different to 0. Looking at the estimated value itself it may seem odd that this value is not significant differernt to 0. To resolve this mysotory lets take a llok at the confidence intervals of the two:\n\n\nconfint.lm(lm(dat$Weight ~ dat$Height))\n\n                  2.5 %     97.5 %\n(Intercept) -433.086166 338.024785\ndat$Height    -1.505342   2.904319\n\nHow is the cofidence interval calculated?\nFor example: 95% C.I. for \\(\\beta_{1}\\): \\[b_{1} ± t_{1-α/2, n-2} * se(b_{1})\\]\nFirst we need to find the t value that “sits” at the lower and upper 2.5% of the t-distribution. We will use the function qt() and will provide us with the t value at 2.5% from a t-ditribution with 3 df.\n\n\nt_value <-  qt(p = .975, df =3, lower.tail = TRUE)\n\n\nWe now have all the unknowns to arrive at the solution.\nLets plug the numbers in and compare it to the 95% confidence interval we obtained above.\n\n\nupper_CI <-  0.6995 + (t_value * 0.6928) \nlower_CI <-  0.6995 - (t_value * 0.6928) \n\nupper_CI\n\n[1] 2.904299\n\nlower_CI\n\n[1] -1.505299\n\nLooking good!\nLets add this line to our scatterplot from before.\n\n\nggplot(data = dat, aes(y = Weight, x = Height)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = .7, color = \"red\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_weight, color=\"blue\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_height, color = \"green\", linetype = \"dashed\") + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  theme_classic() \n\n\n\nLastly, here is how the standard error term is calculated. This term tells us the distance between the data points with respect to their y values and the best fitting line.\n\\[\\sigma^2 = S^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_{i} - \\hat{Y})}{n-2}\\]\nWe need the predicted value for each person in our dataset. We will use the predict.lm() function that will output the predicted values fro every person based on the model lm(weight ~ Height.\n\n\nlm <-  lm(dat$Weight ~ dat$Height)\ndat[,\"predicted_y\"] <-  predict.lm(lm)\n\ndat[,\"predicted_y\"] \n\n[1] 71.38235 78.37724 69.28389 67.88491 86.07161\n\ndat[, \"sqr(y-perd(y))\"] <- (dat$Weight - dat$predicted_y)**2\n\ndat[, \"sqr(y-perd(y))\"]\n\n[1] 129.55796  11.40574 105.75834 404.61683  24.28902\n\nsum <- sum(dat[, \"sqr(y-perd(y))\"])\n\nsqrt(sum/3)\n\n[1] 15.00697\n\nHere is how the t-distribution under the \\(H_{0}\\) looks like:\n\n\nlibrary(latex2exp)\nset.seed(123)\nx <- rt(1000, df = 3)\nx <-  round(x, digit = 3)\ncuts <-  quantile(x , c(0.000, .05, .95, .99999)) \n\n# Create data\nmy_variable = x\n \n# Calculate histogram, but do not draw it\nmy_hist = hist(x , breaks = 190  , plot = F)\n\n \n# Color vector\nmy_color= ifelse(my_hist$breaks <= 2.273526, \"lightgrey\",\n          ifelse(my_hist$breaks >= -2.273526, \"red\", rgb(0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2)))\n \n# Final plot\nplot(my_hist, \n     col = my_color, \n     border = F,\n     freq = FALSE, \n     main = (TeX('Histogram for a $\\\\t$-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom (df)')),\n     xlab = \"possible t values\", \n     xlim = c(-6,6), \n     ylim = c(0,.7), \n    cex.main=0.9)\ncurve(dt(x, df = 3), from = -5, to = 5, n = 500, col = 'red', lwd = 1, add = T)\nabline(v = -0.392, col = \"darkgreen\", lwd = 2,  lty = 'dashed')\nabline(v = 1.010, col = \"blue\", lwd = 2,  lty = 'dashed')\nabline(v = 2.273526, col = \"red\", lwd = 3)\ntext(x = 2.2, y = .7, TeX('t value for $\\\\alpha$'), col = \"blue\")\ntext(x = -1.6, y = .35,  TeX('t value for $\\\\beta$'),  col = \"darkgreen\")\ntext(x = 3.2, y = .15, substitute(paste(bold(\"t critical\"))),  col = \"red\")\n\n\n\nA Note on t-values:\n\\(t-value = \\frac{Estimated Parameter}{SF}\\)\nThe estimate represents the effect or impact that the independent variable has on the dependent variable. The standard error, on the other hand, quantifies the uncertainty or variability associated with that estimate.\nBy dividing the estimate by the standard error, we obtain the t-value. Essentially, the t-value tells us how many standard errors the estimate is away from zero. It helps us assess whether the estimate is statistically significant or just a result of random variation\nAnd a small toy-example for you to play around with 😉\nLet’s move onto the interactive Shiny app plot. The plot allows you to visualize the relationship between two variables and fit a linear model to the data. To use the app, follow these steps:\nChoose the variables from the dropdown menu.\nObserve how the line changes to fit the data points better.\nObserve how the changes in:\nIntercept\nSlope(s)\np-values\nR-squared value as you adjust the model.\nThe app plot is an excellent way to see how the slope and intercept of a linear model can impact the fit of the model to the data. You can also see how the R-squared value changes as you adjust the model, which is a measure of how well the model fits the data. The closer the R-squared value is to 1, the better the model fits the data.\nThe data Im using here is from a built-in dataset in R called “mtcar”.\n\n\nlibrary(knitr)\nkable(head(mtcars))\n\n\n\n\nmpg\n\n\ncyl\n\n\ndisp\n\n\nhp\n\n\ndrat\n\n\nwt\n\n\nqsec\n\n\nvs\n\n\nam\n\n\ngear\n\n\ncarb\n\n\nMazda RX4\n\n\n21.0\n\n\n6\n\n\n160\n\n\n110\n\n\n3.90\n\n\n2.620\n\n\n16.46\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\nMazda RX4 Wag\n\n\n21.0\n\n\n6\n\n\n160\n\n\n110\n\n\n3.90\n\n\n2.875\n\n\n17.02\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\nDatsun 710\n\n\n22.8\n\n\n4\n\n\n108\n\n\n93\n\n\n3.85\n\n\n2.320\n\n\n18.61\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n\nHornet 4 Drive\n\n\n21.4\n\n\n6\n\n\n258\n\n\n110\n\n\n3.08\n\n\n3.215\n\n\n19.44\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\nHornet Sportabout\n\n\n18.7\n\n\n8\n\n\n360\n\n\n175\n\n\n3.15\n\n\n3.440\n\n\n17.02\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\nValiant\n\n\n18.1\n\n\n6\n\n\n225\n\n\n105\n\n\n2.76\n\n\n3.460\n\n\n20.22\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\nAfter looking at the different variables in this dataset, lets see how each of them can be modeled as a linear regression. The blue line represents the best-fitting line (i.e., the line that minimizes the distance between the data and the model – the line with the lowest RSS)\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, linear models are a powerful tool in statistics, and the interactive Shiny app plot provides an excellent way to explore the concepts. With the app, you can experiment with different linear models and see how they fit the data.
