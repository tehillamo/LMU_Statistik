Linear models can be extended to include more than one independent variable, and the equation becomes:


$\color{red}{y{i} = a + \beta_{1} \times X_{1} + \beta_{2} \times X_{2} + … + \beta_{n} \times X_{n}}$

Where $Y$ is the dependent variable, 

$X_{1}$, $X_{2}$, …, $X_{n}$ are the independent variables, 

$\alpha$ is the intercept, 

and $\beta_{1}$,  $\beta_{2}$, …, $\beta_{n}$ are the slopes of the respective variables.
